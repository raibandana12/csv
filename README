##Creation of CSV file upload Java Application

Technology used:
•	Java 8
•	Spring boot 2
•	Maven
•	H2 in-memory
H2 in-memory is used to remove dependency on running a database server.
Classes
•	CsvApplication is a main class.
•	CsvFileController is rest controller where the rest endpoints are defined.
•	CsvReaderService is serveric layer which does the business logic. Controller points to this class and this class interacts with repository CRUD operation.
•	Customer is an entity class which creates table in the database
•	CustomerRepository is an interface which extends jpa repository and inherits methods, not having to write simple CRUD methods.


##Approach
- InputstreamReader reads the bytes and decodes them to character using the specified charset.
- BufferedReader reads from the charaters from inputstreamreader.
- CSVParser parses the read from bufferedreader , also ignores the header for the csv file.
- getRecords() method is used to extract the records from parsers.
- Each record is looped through and a customer object is created for those records and added into a list.
- findByCustomerRef() method is used to store the records to Database
